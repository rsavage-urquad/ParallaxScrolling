# Parallax Scrolling

This is an example of Parallax Scrolling of a background image in a section.  This example was created from the
excellent tutorials from the from the following URL's

* [Simple Parallax Scrolling](http://callmenick.com/post/simple-parallax-scrolling-effect)
* [Advanced Parallax Scrolling](http://callmenick.com/post/advanced-parallax-scrolling-effect)

I created a JavaScript object to make it programmable.  I also added a parameter entry section to allow users to
play with various values.  Finally, this uses JQuery (loaded from MaxCDN).

** Note ** - Liberties and shortcuts were taken (read the Tutorials for a better understanding).
